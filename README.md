# Cub3D

This project aims to recreate the original Doom's iconic raycasting engine, a groundbreaking technology used to render the 3D graphics in the classic video game Doom.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to replicate the raycasting engine used in the original Doom game. The project focuses on generating a 3D environment using raycasting techniques, simulating the illusion of depth and 3D space, and rendering a first-person perspective similar to the Doom game.

### Key Features

- **Raycasting Engine**: Implementation of a raycasting system for rendering 3D environments.
- **First-Person View**: Simulating a first-person view of the environment.
- **Wall Textures**: Applying textures to walls for realistic visuals.
- **Movement and Interaction**: Implementing player movement and interaction with the environment.
- **Bonus Part**: Player orientation with mouse (accelerometer) and top-view level map.
